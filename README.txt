This project is about asymmetric cryptographic.
This project is basicly a tester for a preview work that I can not include because has elements that are private information
of the institute. This work will be publish soon.
I modified a version of a library of BouncyCastle for include new elements. In this case those elements were new elliptic curves.
I modified a version of jdk and with this project I proved that the curves were correctly integrated. I verify that the curves'
names really exist in the library and that it was possible generate public and private keys for used them in cryptographic algorithms.
